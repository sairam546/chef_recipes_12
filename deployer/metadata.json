This is great for working with Capistrano where you need to deploy code, but it doesn't make sense for each user to have a shell account.\n\nThis cookbook will create a deployment user (`deploy` by default) **with passwordless-sudo permissions** for deployment. As a result, it is highly recommended that you disable password authentication and **only** support key-based authentication.\n\nRequirements\n------------\nAt this time, you must have a Unix-based machine. This could easily be adapted for Windows machines. Please submit a Pull Request if you wish to add Windows support.\n\nConfiguration\n-------------\nThere are three attributes that you can override in your node:\n\n- `node['deployer']['user']` - the name of the deploy user (default: `deploy`)\n- `node['deployer']['group']` - the group for the deploy user (default: `deploy`)\n- `node['deployer']['home']` - the home directory for the deploy user (default: `/home/deploy`)\n\n### Adding keys\nThere are two ways to add keys to the `deployer`. If you're using the opscode `users` cookbook, `deployer` easily integrates with the existing `:users` data_bags. Simply add the `servers` key to an existing user:\n\n```json\n// data_bags/users/svargo.json\n{\n  \"id\": \"svargo\",\n  \"uid\": \"1000\",\n  \"deploy\": \"any\"\n}\n```\n\nor specify an array of servers or IP addresses that the user should be allowed to deploy to:\n\n```json\n// data_bags/users/svargo.json\n{\n  \"id\": \"svargo\",\n  \"uid\": \"1000\",\n  \"deploy\": [\n    \"1.2.3.4\",\n    \"mynode.example.com\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nIf you're not using the `users` cookbook, or if you have a conflict, you can use the `:deployers` data_bag instead:\n\nCreate the data_bag:\n\n    knife data bag create deployers\n\nCreate a deployer:\n\n```json\n# data_bags/deployers/svargo.json\n{\n  \"id\": \"svargo\",\n  \"deploy\": [\n    \"1.2.3.4\",\n    \"mynode.example.com\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe same options apply to the `servers` key as above. **Note: this will not actually create system user accounts.**\n\nUsage\n-----\nIf you're using [Berkshelf](http://berkshelf.com/), just add `deployer` to your `Berksfile`:\n\n```ruby\ncookbook 'deployer'\n```\n\nOtherwise, install the cookbook from the community site:\n\n    knife cookbook site install deployer\n\nHave any other cookbooks *depend* on deployer by editing editing the `metadata.rb` for your cookbook.\n\n```ruby\ndepends 'deployer'\n```\n\nOnce you have the cookbook installed, add it to your node's `run_list` or `role`:\n\n```ruby\n\"run_list\": [\n  \"recipe[deployer]\"\n]\n```\n\nAnd override attributes as necessary:\n\n```ruby\n# mynode.example.com\n\"override_attributes\": {\n  \"deployer\": {\n    \"user\": \"apache\",\n    \"group\": \"apache\",\n    \"home\": \"/usr/bin/false\"\n  }\n},\n\"run_list\": [\n  \"recipe[deployer]\"\n]\n```\n\nContributing\n------------\n1. Fork the project\n2. Create a feature branch corresponding to you change\n3. Commit and test thoroughly\n4. Create a Pull Request on github\n    - ensure you add a detailed description of your changes\n\nLicense and Authors\n-------------------\nAuthors: [Seth Vargo](https://github.com/sethvargo) ([@sethvargo](https://twitter.com/sethvargo))\n\nCopyright 2012, Seth Vargo\n",
